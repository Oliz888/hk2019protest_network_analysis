    "In the summer of 2019, lacking confidence in China’s judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissent, Hong Kong citizens demonstrated against the local government led by Chief Executive Carrier Lam to legalize the extradition of suspects to mainland China. Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics on 12 June 2019, the protester’s objectives were becoming the five demands: fully withdraw the extradition bill; implement universal suffrage in Hong Kong, set up an inquiry to probe police brutality; withdraw a characterization of early protests as “riots and release those arrested at protest. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aligned with the decentralized nature of network-movement, Hong Kong 2019 protests are characterized as “formless, shapeless, like water”, as the hardcore protesters organizing in small cells with no formal hierarchy and crowdsourcing their tactics and slogans through social media in a highly dispersed way. This phenomenon is accordance with the theory developed by Swann (2020) in the book of Anarchist Cybernetics: Control and Communication in Radical Politics, which explores how large-scale coordination and communication can happen without central direction, and how social media platforms can facilitate interactive communication and participatory and democratic forms of organization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the mutation of global scenario of social mobilization towards higher intensity of digital network and higher degree of decentralization and autonomy, it’s critical to understand how the evolution spreads on social media and synchronize with the demonstration. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project argue that the decision-making process tend to be more decentralized, the identity can be formed from symbols, and synchrony between network and real-world activities. Using the Twitter data from 2019 Hong Kong Protests caused by the anti-extradition law amendment bill, this paper would use network analysis including K-core decomposition and community detection and sentimental analysis to examine the emotion cascade and propagate from one node to another, the user-hashtag interaction, the evolution of opinion groups and emergence of opinion leaders.
